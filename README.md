# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system. You can tell that a file is a dotfile because the name of the file will begin with a period--a dot! The period at the beginning of a filename or directory name indicates that it is a hidden file or directory. This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs. Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.

## Usage

Details on the software I use and how to setup these dotfiles for your own system, check my [Wiki Page](/wiki) for details.
